(1)  take arguments from  command line,
        we could do node app.js XXX in terminal
        and that XXX can be accessed in .js file using process.argv
        the argument we pass in starts from the 2nd position(note: 0-based array)
(2) to pass in more sub-arguments,
        library: yargs
        example input: node app.js add --title=secrets
                       and
                       node app.js add XXX

(3)In Javascript, if no return is expicitly defined, "undefined" will be defined
        - make use of the return value --> use it as a flag

(4) simplifided version of if/else statements
        - var mesage = noteRemoved ? 'Note was removed' : 'Note Not found';

(5)make use of module.export to separate export functions and local functions(sort of encapsulation)
